  Welcome on documentation for Typescript Wrapper for Twitch Embed player and/or chat based on [official Twitch Embed API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/).
</Callout>

## Installation
<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        npm i @anivire/twitch-embed-ts
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        yarn add @anivire/twitch-embed-ts
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


## Basic usage
Be sure to add the official Twitch Embed or Player script to your `index.html` first:
```html
<script src="https://embed.twitch.tv/embed/v1.js"></script>
<!-- OR / AND -->
<script src="https://player.twitch.tv/embed/v1.js"></script>
```

### Creating new TwitchEmbed instance
`TwitchEmbed` allows you to embed anything, including a player and/or chat. It also contains a `TwitchPlayer`, which can be interacted by calling `embed.getPlayer()`:
```ts
const embed = new TwitchEmbed(
    'twitch-embed', 
    options: {
        width: '1280',
        height: '720',
        channel: 'anivire_',
        parent: ['anivire.xyz']
    });
```

1. First argument `TwitchEmbed` is the identifier for the `<div>` in which the Twitch player will be embedded as a `<iframe>`.

2. Second argument is an object with player settings, which include parameters width, player height, and channel / video / collection, where channel has highest priority, meaning if both channel and video are specified, only channel (live) will be used.

    Additionally, instead of a numeric value for height and width you can specify a percentage size, for example `100%`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    It is also important to specify the domain in `parent` where your player will be hosted for correct player behavior.
</Callout>

### Creating new TwitchPlayer instance
`TwitchPlayer` allows you to embed only player, without chat:
```ts
const player = new TwitchPlayer(
    'twitch-player', 
    options: {
        width: '1280',
        height: '720',
        video: '2064229582',
        parent: ['anivire.xyz']
    });
```
